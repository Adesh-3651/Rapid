# 🌍 Rapid: A Lifeline in Times of Disaster

Rapid is a disaster management platform created to save lives during moments of chaos. Whether faced with man-made or natural disasters, Rapid helps people find their way to safety by marking safe zones on maps. Inspired by the Ukrainian platform developed during the Russia-Ukraine war, we aim to provide a solution that can make the difference between life and death in critical situations.

# ⚡️ Mission: Save Lives, Fast

Rapid is built to help people navigate through emergencies, whether it's a bombing or a flood. Our platform is designed to provide real-time guidance to citizens, ensuring they can quickly locate the nearest safe zones and avoid dangerous areas.

# 🌪️ What Rapid Handles:

Man-Made Disasters: Currently focused on bombing scenarios, with future plans to expand to other crises.

Natural Disasters: Handling flood situations with plans for further natural disaster management (earthquakes, storms, etc.).

# 🚀 Features

Real-Time Safe Zones: Users can see safe locations marked on a map, helping them quickly find shelter.

Multi-Disaster Readiness: Whether it’s a bombing or flood, Rapid is designed to tackle both and more as we expand.
